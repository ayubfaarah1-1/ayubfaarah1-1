# Hey, I'm Ayub 👋

I'm a Backend Software Engineer based in Minneapolis. I build APIs, design databases, and write the services that sit between systems. A lot of my work involves making sure data moves reliably between services, whether that's through Kafka pipelines or structured queries.

I love solving real-world problems—the kind where someone is stuck doing something manually or a process is breaking down. Most of my side projects started that way.

## Currently building

**[Referra](https://referraai.com)** — Connects case managers to reliable healthcare providers in Minnesota. Providers are ranked by feedback from clients and case managers, so you can match people based on what actually matters: cultural fit, services offered, staff type available, and more.

**[Accredio](https://accredio.ai)** — Document storage and compliance tool for ABA clinics. Uses OCR to pull key dates from PDFs and flag expiring credentials. Has a built-in AI chat assistant that answers compliance questions using your uploaded documents and MCO requirements.

**[VibeGuard](https://vibeguard-h8pc.vercel.app/)** — Cybersecurity agents that scan your codebase, database, and deployment setup. Finds the stuff that gets apps exposed and tells you how to fix it.

At work, I've built backend services that move over a million events a day across 1,900+ stores.

## When I'm not coding

I run. Training for my first marathon this year. I snowboard in the winter, travel when I get the chance, and try to spend real time with family and friends.
