# Hey, I'm Ayub 👋

I'm a Backend Software Engineer based out of Minneapolis. I build APIs, design databases, and write the services that sit between systems. A lot of my work involves making sure data moves reliably between services, whether that's through Kafka pipelines or structured queries.

I love solving real world problems. The kind where someone is stuck doing something manually or a process is breaking down or isn't efficient as a whole, and I can build something to optimize it or fix it end to end or completely redesign it. Most of my side projects started that way.

## Currently building

**[Referra](https://referraai.com)** — Connects case managers to reliable healthcare providers in Minnesota. Providers are ranked by feedback from clients and case managers, so you can match people based on what actually matters: cultural fit, services offered, staff type available, and more.

**[Accredio](https://accredio.ai)** — Document storage and compliance tool for ABA clinics. Uses OCR to pull key dates from PDFs and flag expiring credentials. Has a built-in AI chat assistant that answers compliance questions using your uploaded documents and MCO requirements.

**[Vibe Guard](https://vibeguard-h8pc.vercel.app/)** — Cybersecurity agents that scan your codebase, database, and deployment setup. Finds the stuff that gets apps exposed and tells you how to fix it.

## Tech I use

Kotlin, Java, Python, TypeScript. PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis, Kafka. AWS, GCP, Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform.

At work, I've built backend services that move over a million events a day across 1,900+ stores.

## When I'm not coding

I run. Training for my first marathon this year. I snowboard in the winter, travel when I get the chance, and try to spend real time with family and friends.
